# Endorsement Page Webapp! 

## Details

#### DEPLOYED SITE HERE: https://sseatter-endorsement-app.netlify.app/ 
<p> SOLO project through scrimba frontend course - stretch goals completed: making a like button (that can only be pressed once), added To and From input fields to further customize the endorsement</p>

<p>This project was to create an endorsement app where an employee can write an endorsement and address it to one of their co-workers! They can submit and it will be displayed in a feed for everyone to see and others can press a heart to like the endorsement. </p>

<p>In this project I was able to follow a Figma file for the design and recreate it through code, use Firebase to persist the data, and deploy the app through netlify</p>

<p>Some things I would like to improve upon:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Refactoring HTML tags to make it more web accessible and clear, i.e instead of using ul, li elments to display endorsement, use divs and h4, p tags to make it more clear</li>
  <li>Logins so other people can add likes to the endorsement and can be used by more people</li>
</ul>
